    <h4>Reference Projects (Not coded by me)</h4>
    <a href="digitRecognizer">Digit Recognizer Image Analysis</a><br>
    This project was published over at <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/guide/keras/">https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/guide/keras/</a> and was mostly hand-transcribed with some minor modifications purely for digging into Deep Machine Learning using Keras with Tensorflow.  Consider this purely a reference piece for myself for future deep learning projects of my own.<br><br>

    <a href="kyphosis">Kyphosis Medical Condition</a><br>
    Showcases Keras neural nets on a categorical prediction problem using standard sequential models.<br><br>

    <a href="cifar10">CIFAR10 Image Classification</a><br>
    Showcases Keras neural nets on a multiclass categorical image classification problem.<br><br>

    <a href="bicycleRentals">Bicycle Rentals Linear Regression</a><br>
    Showcases considerable depth in approaching linear regression techniques, both single and multiple linear regression.  Heavily based on chapter 4 of the book "Machine Learning in R", with some additional work put in by myself for future reference in projects of my own.<br><br>

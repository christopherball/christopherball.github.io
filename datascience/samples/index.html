    <h4>Reference Projects (Not coded by me)</h4>
    <a href="digitRecognizer/digitRecognizer.nb.html">Digit Recognizer Image Analysis</a><br>
    This project was published over at <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/guide/keras/">https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/guide/keras/</a> and was mostly hand-transcribed with some minor modifications purely for digging into Deep Machine Learning using Keras with Tensorflow.  Consider this purely a reference piece for myself for future deep learning projects of my own.<br><br>

    <a href="kyphosis/kyphosis.nb.html">Kyphosis Medical Condition</a><br>
    Showcases Keras neural nets on a categorical prediction problem using standard sequential models.<br><br>

    <a href="cifar10/cifar10.nb.html">CIFAR10 Image Classification</a><br>
    Showcases Keras neural nets on a multiclass categorical image classification problem.<br><br>

    <a href="bicycleRentals/bicycleRentals.nb.html">Bicycle Rentals Linear Regression</a><br>
    Showcases considerable depth in approaching linear regression techniques, both single and multiple linear regression.  Heavily based on chapter 4 of the book "Machine Learning in R", with some additional work put in by myself for future reference in projects of my own.<br><br>

    While this example is honestly not that great, as it faces major class imbalance issues that aren't elegantly handled, it does show the general process and method of attack.  See chapter 5 of "Machine Learning in R".  One of the observations I had about this project was the grey area on what it means to produce an accurate model with class imbalance issues.  You could be accurate for the majority and inaccurate for the minority, accurate for the minority and inaccurate for the majority, or somewhere in between.  Good learning experience.

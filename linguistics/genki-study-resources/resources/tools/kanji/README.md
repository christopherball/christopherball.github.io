# Kanji Decks for Genki Study Resources
This folder contains [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) decks for the Kanji in Genki. You can find them in the [lessons-3rd](lessons-3rd/) folder. Please note that there is no folder for the 2nd Edition as the contents are the same as the 3rd Edition.


### How to Download the Decks

You can download the decks online [here](https://sethclydesdale.github.io/genki-study-resources/help/anki-decks/). The instructions below are for downloading from GitHub.

To download a single deck, you can go to an edition's folder, click the deck, and then download it via the download button. 

To download all decks at once, you can [download this repo](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/genki-study-resources/archive/master.zip), unzip the contents, then navigate to **resources/tools/kanji** and open the folder for the 3rd Edition (lessons-3rd) to access the decks.


### How to Import the Decks
Once you have your decks, open Anki and click "Import File" (or go to File > Import...) to import your decks. 

That's it, you're done. Now you're ready to study the vocab!

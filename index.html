    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    This page serves as a landing zone for easy access to some of my personal programming projects (where possible to showcase via a browser).  If you're in search of my source code, start here: <a href="https://github.com/christopherball">https://github.com/christopherball</a>. If you don't see the code repository you might be looking for, it's likely sitting in a private repository for the time being. <br><br>

    <h2>Data Science</h2>
    <h4>Personal Projects</h4>
    <a href="/datascience/titanic/titanic.nb.html">Titanic Survivor Analysis</a><br>
    This project was directly inspired by the ongoing Titanic competition at Kaggle.com.  It was my first dive into both R as well as classification ML, resulting in approximately 79% accuracy for predicting which people would live and die on the Titanic, resulting in a placement in the top 10% of current participants (~17,000).  Keep in mind this project, which was used for learning, apparently has the "answers" out there somewhere so the leaderboards for this competition aren't particularly meaningful.  This was a great learning experience nevertheless.

    <a href="/datascience/mathFormulas.nb.html">Math Formulas Explained</a><br>
    This project is on-going and highlights in my own words, in-depth analysis of math formulas specific to data-science (primarily of the statistical nature).  The goal here is to breakdown and truly understand industry standard formulas, such as RMSE, Adjusted R-Squared, etc...

    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <h4>Tools</h4>
    <a href="/math/asciiMath">AsciiMath Tools</a><br>
    This mini-project was basically a tool port, whereby I re-wrote my own version of the asciiMath demo site and ported over their syntax documentation.  This tool makes it possible to cleanly produce LaTex-like math formulas by combining two JavaScript libraries: AsciiMath, and MathJax.

    <h2>Linguistics</h2>
    <h4>Personal Projects</h4>
    <a href="">Japanese Video Player (JVP) Offline (Coming soon...)</a><br>
    Built for personal Japanese language studies, featuring cutting-edge language aquisition features, such as synchronized subtitle video pausing, kanji colorization signifying varying levels of retention via AnkiConnect and Yomichan integration, complete ability to work offline, minimial interface, and ability to toggle furigana display (based on proprietary processing of .vtt subtitle files).

    <h2>Computer Science</h2>
    <h4>Personal Projects</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/christopherball/dataStructuresJS">Data Structures JS</a></br>
    Built common programming data structures using pure EcmaScript6 and NodeJS.  Coverage includes binary search trees, doubly linked lists, hash tables, queues and stacks.

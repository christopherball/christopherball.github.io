        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        This page serves as a deployment space for easy access to some of my
        personal programming projects and tool ports. If you're in search of my
        github details,
        <a href="https://github.com/christopherball">go here</a>.

        <h2>Personal Programming Projects</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>Data Science</h3>
        <a href="/datascience/titanic/titanic.nb.html"
            >Titanic Survivor Analysis</a
        ><br />
        This project is directly inspired by the ongoing Titanic competition at
        Kaggle.com. It was my first dive into both R as well as classification
        ML, resulting in approximately 79% accuracy for predicting which people
        would live and die on the Titanic, resulting in a placement in the top
        10% of current participants (~17,000). Keep in mind this project, which
        was used for learning, apparently has the "answers" out there somewhere
        so the leaderboards for this competition aren't particularly meaningful.
        This was a great learning experience nevertheless.<br />

        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <a href="/math/asciiMath">AsciiMath Tool</a><br />
        This tool makes it possible to cleanly produce LaTex-like math formulas
        by leveraging two JavaScript libraries: AsciiMath, and MathJax. This
        project includes several core features I wrote on top of the base
        libraries, including my own responsive version of the asciiMath demo
        site, added support for multi-line output, a dark zen editor mode,
        ability to comment out lines of formula, animation simulation on a
        per-line basis, as well as the ability to directly share links to your
        rendered math formulas.<br /><br />

        <a href="/math/mathFormulas/mathFormulas.nb.html"
            >Math Formulas Explained</a
        ><br />
        This project is on-going and highlights in my own words (although I may
        reference diagrams where helpful), in-depth analysis of math formulas,
        often times specific to data-science (primarily of the statistical
        nature). The goal here is to breakdown and truly understand common math
        formulas. So in the case of statistics, examples might include RMSE and
        Adjusted R-Squared for example.

        <h3>Linguistics</h3>
        <a href="/linguistics/kanjiRadicalExplorer">Kanji Radical Explorer</a
        ><br />
        This is a simplified comprehensive representation of all classic Kanji
        radicals, based on KanjiAlive's open sourced data. Of special note here
        is the content within this table uses a custom font specifically built
        to natively render kanji sub-components that don't necessarily get
        first-class treatment as standard radicals (but are in fact variants of
        standard radicals).

        <h3>Tech</h3>
        <a href="https://christopherball.github.io/tech/networkVisualizer/"
            >Network Visualizer</a
        ><br />
        This is custom-built network graphing tool based on the vis.js
        vis-network library which offers the ability to draw graphs using the
        DOT language. I wrote a ton of customization on top, including the
        following new functionality: fullscreen mode, fit-to-center, canvas
        scaling for high-quality large-scale (bigger than browser) image saving
        with white backing, case-insensitive multi-node searching based on
        substring, and support for custom DOT network loading. I have also
        pre-loaded this tool with a (nearly) complete network graph for the
        amazing book and tv series:

            href="https://christopherball.github.io/tech/networkVisualizer/viewer.html?load=TLK"
            >The Last Kingdom</a
        >.

        <h2>Tool Ports</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>Linguistics</h3>
        <a href="/linguistics/mr-kanji-search-wtk">Kanji Reverse Lookup</a
        ><br />
        This is a straight tool port of a highly useful search tool for
        reverse-looking up Kanji by their containing parts (radicals in the case
        of Wanikani, primitives in the case of Remembering the Kanji by James
        Heisig).

        <h3>Tech</h3>
        <a href="https://christopherball.github.io/tech/sequenceDiagram/"
            >Sequence Diagram Editor</a
        ><br />
        This is a straight tool port, brought over with the sole intention of
        preserving a working copy, as it's a very helpful diagramming tool for
        design work that I use all the time.<br /><br />

        <a href="https://christopherball.github.io/tech/steganography/"
            >Steganography</a
        ><br />
        This is a straight tool port of an old JavaScript-based image
        steganography tool. It not only hides data randomly across the image,
        but applies encryption before doing so.<br /><br />

        <a href="https://christopherball.github.io/tech/graphToy/">Graph Toy</a
        ><br />
        This is a straight tool port with minor modifications for the purposes
        of visualizing graph plots for GLSL shader programming.<br /><br />

        <a href="https://christopherball.github.io/tech/pdfjs/web/viewer.html"
            >Pdf.js Viewer</a
        ><br />
        This is a straight tool port that I use for viewing PDF files in the
        browser so that I can leverage browser extensions in combination with
        PDF files.<br /><br />

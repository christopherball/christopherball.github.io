    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    This page serves as a landing zone for easy access to some of the outputs of my personal programming projects (where possible to showcase via a browser). Pure source code for said projects resides at <a href="https://github.com/christopherball">https://github.com/christopherball</a>. If you don't see the code repository you might be looking for, it's likely sitting in a private repository for the time being. <br><br>

    <h2>Data Science</h2>
    <h4>Personal Projects</h4>
    <a href="/datascience/titanic">Titanic Survivor Analysis</a><br>
    This project was directly inspired by the ongoing Titanic competition at Kaggle.com.  It was my first dive into both R as well as classification ML, resulting in approximately 79% accuracy for predicting which people would live and die on the Titanic, resulting in a placement in the top 10% of current participants (~17,000).  Keep in mind this project, which was used for learning, apparently has the "answers" out there somewhere so the leaderboards for this competition aren't particularly meaningful.  This was a great learning experience nevertheless.

    <h4>Reference Projects (Not coded by me)</h4>
    <a href="/datascience/digitRecognizer">Digit Recognizer Image Analysis</a><br>
    This project was published over at <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/guide/keras/">https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/guide/keras/</a> and was mostly hand-transcribed with some minor modifications purely for digging into Deep Machine Learning using Keras with Tensorflow.  Consider this purely a reference piece for myself for future deep learning projects of my own.

    <h2>Linguistics</h2>
    <h4>Personal Projects</h4>
    <a href="">Japanese Video Player (JVP) Offline (Coming soon...)</a><br>
    Built for personal Japanese language studies, featuring cutting-edge language aquisition features, such as synchronized subtitle video pausing, kanji colorization signifying varying levels of retention via AnkiConnect and Yomichan integration, complete ability to work offline, minimial interface, and ability to toggle furigana display (based on proprietary processing of .vtt subtitle files).

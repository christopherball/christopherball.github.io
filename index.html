    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    This page serves as a landing zone for easy accessibility to some of the outputs of my personal programming projects (where possible to showcase via a browser). 
    Pure source code for said projects resides at <a href="https://github.com/christopherball">https://github.com/christopherball</a>.  
    If you don't see the code repository you might be looking for, it's likely sitting in a private repository for the time being.<br>

    <h2>Data Science</h2>
    <h4>Personal Projects</h4>
    <a href="/datascience/titanic">Titanic Survivor Analysis</a><br>
    Project directly driven by the Titanic competition at Kaggle.com.  This project resulted in approximately 79% accuracy for predicting which people would live and die on the Titanic, resulting in a placement in the top 10%.  Keep in mind this project, which was used for learning, apparently has the "answers" out there so the leaderboards for this competition aren't particularly meaningful.

    <h4>Reference Projects (Not coded by me)</h4>
    <a href="/datascience/digitRecognizer">Digit Recognizer Image Analysis</a><br>
    This project was published over at <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/guide/keras/">https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/guide/keras/</a> and was mainly hand-transcribed with some minor modifications purely for digging into Machine Deep Learning using Keras with Tensorflow.  Consider this purely a reference for myself for future deep learning projects of my own.

    <h2>Linguistics</h2>
    <h4>Personal Projects</h4>
    <a href="">Japanese Video Player (JVP) Offline (Coming soon...)</a><br>
    Built for personal Japanese language studies, featuring cutting-edge language aquisition features, such as subtitle pausing, kanji colorization signifying varying levels of retention via AnkiConnect integration, complete ability to work offline.
